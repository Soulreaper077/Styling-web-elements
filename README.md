# Styling-Web-Elements

This is a readme file for my git hub repository Styling-Web-Elements. We are currently on module 1 and working on refactoring html and css code for the Horiseon website. what is going on with the repository is the code was cleaned up as well as grouped together in sections that may make it easier to understand. on top of this, I also worked to remove any repeating code and made the page more dry. nothing was changed within the website itself and all the links and styling are working properly.
